Prerequisites
Java Application Code: Hosted on a Git repository
Jenkins Server: To manage and run the pipeline
Kubernetes Cluster: For container orchestration
Helm: Package manager for Kubernetes
Argo CD: For continuous delivery and deployment
Steps
1. Install Necessary Jenkins Plugins
Git Plugin: To integrate with Git repositories.
Maven Integration Plugin: To build Java applications with Maven.
Pipeline Plugin: For defining and running Jenkins pipelines.
Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin: For deploying applications to Kubernetes.
2. Create a New Jenkins Pipeline
Create Pipeline Job: In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the Git repository URL for your Java application.
Add Jenkinsfile: Define the pipeline stages in a Jenkinsfile located in the Git repository.
3. Define Pipeline Stages
Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
Stage 2: Build the Java application using Maven.
Stage 3: Run unit tests with JUnit and Mockito.
Stage 4: Perform SonarQube analysis to check code quality.
Stage 5: Package the application into a JAR file.
Stage 6: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
Stage 7: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
Stage 8: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.
4. Configure Jenkins Pipeline Stages
Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code.
Stage 2: Use the Maven Integration plugin for the build process.
Stage 3: Utilize JUnit and Mockito plugins for testing.
Stage 4: Use the SonarQube plugin for code quality analysis.
Stage 5: Leverage the Maven plugin to package the JAR file.
Stage 6: Deploy to Kubernetes using the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin and Helm.
Stage 7: Execute user acceptance tests using a framework like Selenium.
Stage 8: Integrate with Argo CD for production deployment.
5. Set Up Argo CD
Install Argo CD: On the Kubernetes cluster.
Set Up Git Repository: For Argo CD to track Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests.
Create Helm Chart: For the Java application, including Kubernetes manifests and Helm values.
Add Helm Chart to Git Repository: Tracked by Argo CD.
6. Configure Jenkins Pipeline Integration with Argo CD
Add Argo CD API Token: To Jenkins credentials.
Update Pipeline: Include the Argo CD deployment stage.
7. Run and Monitor the Jenkins Pipeline
Trigger Pipeline: Start the CI/CD process.
Monitor Stages: Check the pipeline progress and address any issues.
